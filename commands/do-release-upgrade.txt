There are several ways to upgrade from one Ubuntu release to another. 
This section gives an overview of the recommended upgrade method.

Debian based systems can also be upgraded by using apt dist-upgrade. 
However, using do-release-upgrade is recommended because it has the 
ability to handle system configuration changes sometimes needed between
releases.
