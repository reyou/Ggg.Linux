What is the difference between apt-get update and upgrade?
https://askubuntu.com/questions/94102/what-is-the-difference-between-apt-get-update-and-upgrade
You should first run update, then upgrade. Neither of them automatically runs the other.

apt-get update updates the list of available packages and their versions, but 
it does not install or upgrade any packages.
apt-get upgrade actually installs newer versions of the packages you have. After 
updating the lists, the package manager knows about available updates for the 
software you have installed. This is why you first want to update.
