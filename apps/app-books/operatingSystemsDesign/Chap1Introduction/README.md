By the early 1960s, most computer manufacturers had two distinct, and totally incompatible,
product lines. On the one hand there were the word-oriented, large-scale scientific computers,
such as the 7094, which were used for numerical calculations in science and engineering. On the
other hand, there were the character-oriented, commercial computers, such as the 1401, which
were widely used for tape sorting and printing by banks and insurance companies.
Developing, maintaining, and marketing two completely different product lines was an expensive
proposition for the computer manufacturers. In addition, many new computer customers initially
needed a small machine but later outgrew it and wanted a bigger machine that had the same
architectures as their current one so it could run all their old programs, but faster.

The greatest strength of the "one family" idea was simultaneously its greatest weakness. The
intention was that all software, including the operating system, OS/360, had to work on all
models. It had to run on small systems, which often just replaced 1401s for copying cards to
tape, and on very large systems, which often replaced 7094s for doing weather forecasting and
other heavy computing. It had to be good on systems with few peripherals and on systems with
many peripherals. It had to work in commercial environments and in scientific environments.
Above all, it had to be efficient for all of these different uses.
